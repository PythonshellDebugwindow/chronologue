        Chronologue is a site for the creation of constructed languages. It allows you to
        manage your languages' dictionaries, grammar, phonologies, orthographies, and more.
      </InfoParagraph>
      <InfoParagraph>
        Specifically, the site is intended to make it easier and more convenient to create
        and manage large language families (diachronic conlanging), but it also works well
        for creating individual languages.
